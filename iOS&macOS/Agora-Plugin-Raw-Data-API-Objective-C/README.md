This section shows you how to prepare, build, and run the sample application.

### Obtain an App Id

To build and run the sample application, get an App Id:

1. Create a developer account at [agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/). Once you finish the signup process, you will be redirected to the Dashboard.
2. Navigate in the Dashboard tree on the left to **Projects** > **Project List**.
3. Save the **App Id** from the Dashboard for later use.
4. Generate a temp **Access Token** (valid for 24 hours) from dashboard page with given channel name, save for later use.

5. Open `Agora-Plugin-Raw-Data-API-iOS-Objective-C.xcodeproj` and edit the `KeyCenter.swift` file. Update `<#Your App Id#>` with your App Id, and assign the token variable with the temp Access Token generated from dashboard.

    ``` Swift
    static let AppId: String = <#Your App Id#>
    // assign token to nil if you have not enabled app certificate
    static var Token: String? = <#Temp Access Token#>
    ```
