*其他语言版本： [简体中文](README.md)*

The Android Sample App is an open-source demo that will help you get live video broadcasting integrated directly into your Android applications using the Agora Video SDK.

With this sample app, you can:

- Join / leave channel
- Mute / unmute audio
- Switch camera
- Setup resolution, frame rate and bit rate
- Switching mode, a large number of small or two line paved modes

## Running the App
First, create a developer account at [Agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/), and obtain an App ID. Update "app/src/main/res/values/strings_config.xml" with your App ID.

```
<string name="private_app_id"><#YOUR APP ID#></string>
```

Next, download the **Agora Video SDK** from [Agora.io SDK](https://www.agora.io/en/download/). Unzip the downloaded SDK package and copy ***.jar** under **libs** to **app/libs**, **arm64-v8a**/**x86**/**armeabi-v7a** under **libs** to **app/src/main/libs**.

Finally, open project with Android Studio, connect your Android device, build and run.

Or use `Gradle` to build and run.

## Developer Environment Requirements
- Android Studio 2.0 or above
- Real devices (Nexus 5X or other devices)
- Some simulators are function missing or have performance issue, so real device is the best choice
