# Agora-MutilProcess-Education-ShareScreen

*English | [中文](README.zh.md)*

This tutorial shows you how to streaming camera video and screen sharing simultaneously using the Agora sample app.

The small demo contains following features:

- Join/Leave Channel     
- Start/Stop ScreenSharing
- Two Process

## Developer Environment Requirements
* VC2013 or higher
* WIN7 or higher

## Run the sample program
First, create a developer account at [Agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/), and obtain an App ID. define the APP_ID with your App ID.

     #define APP_ID _T("Your App ID")

Next, download the **Agora Video SDK** from [Agora.io SDK](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/downloads). Unzip the downloaded SDK package and copy the **sdk(before 3.0.1)** to the "Agora-Screen-Sharing-Windows" folder in project(the old one may be over written). Since 3.0.1, you need to create sdk folder, sdk/include sdk/lib sdk/dll, and copy files to corresponding folders.

Finally, Open OpenLive.sln, build the solution and run.

**Note：**

  1. After the program is compiled, if the program "xxx\xxx\xxx\Debug\Language\English.dll" cannot be started when running the program, 
      please select the OpenLive project in the Solution Explorer and right click. In the pop-up menu bar, select "Set as active project" to solve. Then run the program again.
  
  2. The dll library under the sdk/dll file needs to be placed in the corresponding execution path.
